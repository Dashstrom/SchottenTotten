# schotten-totten
Gameplay in Schotten-Totten resembles simultaneous play of nine separate hands of poker, but where each hand has only three cards in it. There are nine "boundary" stones between players at the start of the game. Players vie to win five of the stones, or three adjacent ones, to win the game.
